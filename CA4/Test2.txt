SINGAPORE - The existential threat of climate change is an issue that nations cannot ignore,
Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifli said on Monday (Oct 21)
at the first Singapore meeting of scientists from the United Nations' climate science body.
"We must not take our eyes off the long-term, existential challenge of climate change.
Otherwise, citizens will take their cause to the streets and reason will fail to rule," he said,
highlighting the scale of the issue in his strongest comments on climate change to date.
Citizens around the world, including young people, have recognised climate change as a defining
issue of their time, Mr Masagos said, citing the global school strikes for climate and
Singapore's first climate rally at Hong Lim Park in September.
