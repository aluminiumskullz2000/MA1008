Dear son,

I am writing this letter slowly because I know you cannot read fast.

We do not live in the house where you grew up any more because your dad read that most accidents
happen at home. So we moved. I cannot send you the new address because the family from whom we
bought the new house took the address with them because they liked it. It rained occasionally
here last week; only twice, the first time for three days and the second time for four days.

Your aunt Margaret wanted to send you a coat she bought for you, but it was too bulky to go in
the parcel post in one piece. So we removed the sleeves and sent them to you separately.

Look after yourself and keep smiling.

Love always,
Mom
